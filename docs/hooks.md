# Dredd Hooks documentation

Dredd can load JavaScript or CoffeeScript files and process them.
The interface to communicate and actually use hooks is achieved through
requiring virtual `hooks` dependency provided by Dredd.

------

## First things first

You'd need __names__ of your transactions (_actions_) before proceeding further.
In order to do that please run Dredd with the `--names` argument as the last one
and it'll print all available names of transactions.

If you have an API Blueprint in `single_get.md` file, you can retrieve all
transaction names like this:

```sh
$ dredd single_get.md http://machines.apiary.io --names
info: Machines > Machines collection > Get Machines
```

## To run Dredd with hooks

Dredd uses [glob](http://npmjs.com/package/glob) when searching for files.
So use wildcard(s) to traverse the file tree and read files with your hooks.

Run validation with hooks from file names ending with `_hooks` without extensions:

```sh
dredd single_get.md http://machines.apiary.io --hookfiles=*_hooks.*
```

## Hook types: before, after, beforeAll, afterAll

Dredd provides four types of hooks. _Single transaction hooks_ or _all transactions hooks_.

You must provide __transaction name__ in order to tell what function the
__single transaction hook__ should be called upon.
The first argument is a _string_ (transaction name), second argument is
the _function_.

If you use __all transactions hooks__, please use only one argumentâ€“the actual function.

- __before__ hooks are called before every single transaction
- __after__ hooks are called after every single transaction,
  regardless its success or failure status
- __beforeAll__ hooks are called at the beginning of the whole test
- __afterAll__ hooks are called after all transactions have set their end status


### Hook types examples

Let's have an example hookfile `machines_hooks.coffee`:

```coffee
{before, after} = require 'hooks'

before "Machines > Machines collection > Get Machines", (transaction) ->
  console.log "before"

after "Machines > Machines collection > Get Machines", (transaction) ->
  console.log "after"
```

Usage of asynchronous `beforeAll` and `afterAll` hooks:

```coffee
{beforeAll, afterAll} = require 'hooks'

beforeAll (done) ->
  # do setup
  done()

afterAll (done) ->
  # do teardown
  done()
```

If `beforeAll` and `afterAll` are called multiple times, the callbacks
are executed [serially][] (in the order hook files were loaded from filesystem).

[serially]: http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/serially

## Synchronous vs. Asynchronous hook

As you might've probably noticed, hooks can be executed both synchronously and
asynchronously. __Hook is a function__. First argument received is always a transaction
object and it __must__ be defined in the [function arguments](http://mdn.io/function).
More about transaction object can be found in [transaction object documentation](docs/transaction.md).

```js
var hooks = require('hooks');
var before = hooks.before;
var myHook = function (transaction, callback) {
  console.log(transaction.fullPath); // access to URL of the transaction
  // ...your own asynchronous task
  // once finished, just call callback
  callback();
}
```

__Optional__ second argument for the hook function is a __callback__.

Dredd looks for number of arguments and behaves accordingly. If you do not provide
any argument name, Dredd won't call that hook function, because Dredd doesn't know
what type of hook it is.

You are free to use hooks with just one argument (the transaction object).
We do not force you to use callbacks if you do not need that.

## Fail or Skip a transaction inside a hook

Transaction can be skipped or failed. Just set the appropriate property.

Skipping a validation with hooks:

```coffee
before "Machines > Machines collection > Get Machines", (transaction) ->
  transaction.skip = true
```

Failing a validation with hooks:

```coffee
before "Machines > Machines collection > Get Machines", (transaction) ->
  transaction.fail = "Some failing message"
```


## Advanced Examples

You can also require [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) and use its assertions in
before/after hooks and it'll determine if the transaction is or isn't failing:

```coffee
{before, after} = require 'hooks'
{assert} = require 'chai'

after "Machines > Machines collection > Get Machines", (transaction) ->
  assert.isBelow transaction.real.body.length, 100
```


### Append Query Parameter to every URL


```coffee
hooks = require 'hooks'

# New hooks helper function
hooks._beforeEach = (hookFn) ->
  hooks.beforeAll (done) ->
    for transactionKey, transaction of hooks.transactions or {}
      hooks.beforeHooks[transaction.name] ?= []
      hooks.beforeHooks[transaction.name].unshift hookFn
    done()

# call the hooks helper function to actually add new hook
hooks._beforeEach (transaction) ->
  # add query parameter to each transaction here
  paramToAdd = "foo=bar"
  if transaction.fullPath.indexOf('?') > -1
    transaction.fullPath += "&" + paramToAdd
  else
    transaction.fullPath += "?" + paramToAdd
```


### OAuth

Let's say you have installed the [oauth](http://www.npmjs.org/package/oauth) package.
And also you have a function to retrieve the token from the OAuth provider
of your choice somewhere inside your custom hook.

```javascript
var OAuth2 = OAuth.OAuth2;

// your twitter application
var twitterConsumerKey = process.env.TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY;
var twitterConsumerSecret = process.env.TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET;

retrieveOauth2Token = function(callback) {
  var oauth2 = new OAuth2(
    yourTwitterConsumerKey,
    yourTwitterConsumerSecret,
    'https://api.twitter.com/',
    null, 'oauth2/token', null
  );
  oauth2.getOAuthAccessToken('',
    {'grant_type':'client_credentials'},
    function (e, access_token, refresh_token, results){
      callback("bearer:" + access_token);
  });
}

var hooks = require("hooks");
var retrievedPlaintextToken = '';
hooks.beforeAll(function(done) {
  if (retrievedPlaintextToken) {
    return done();
  }
  else {
    retrieveOauth2Token(function(token){
      retrievedPlaintextToken = token;
      done();
    });
  }
});

```

This way you can retrieve the token. To actually use it as a query parameter,
you can use similar approach from the Append Query Parameter example above.
